Since beta 1, we do not preinstall all the dependencies anymore except for a few critical ones:

- Python3 PIP
- psutil
- PyYAML
- toml


If you are looking for the actual dependencies, once installed, have a look here:

- [System](https://github.com/project-alice-assistant/ProjectAlice/blob/master/sysrequirements.txt)
- [Python](https://github.com/project-alice-assistant/ProjectAlice/blob/master/requirements.txt)
