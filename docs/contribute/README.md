A lot of things could be improved and enriched with you collaboration no matter if you are a experienced developer or not. Below you will find just some guidelines for inspiration.

## Documentation
You can write, translate and improve ProjectAlice's documentation. Each page has a link to its source code, so you can easily edit and send a PR if you find a typo or something is not clear enough.

## Core
Find an open issue to tackle. New features are welcome!

### Inform an Issue
- **What issues can I inform?**

Besides informing a **bug**, you can **propose features, ideas, etc**. 

You can also open an issue if something in the **documentation** is not clear enough. 

- **How to inform?**

Just try to explain **what happens** and **what is expected to happen** . Also, it would very useful to provide **a way to reproduce the issue** and **logs that show the issue**
