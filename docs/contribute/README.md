# Contributing

First of all, thank you for being interested in contributing to **ProjectAlice**. üôè 

A lot of things could be improved and enriched with you collaboration no matter if you are an experienced developer or not. Below you will find just some guidelines for inspiration.

## Documentation
You can write, translate and improve ProjectAlice's documentation. Each page has a link to its source code, so you can easily edit and send a PR if you find a typo or something that's not clear enough.

## Core
Find an open issue to tackle. New features are welcome!

### Inform an Issue
- **What issues can I report?**

Besides reporting a **bug**, you can **propose features, ideas, etc**. 

You can also open an issue if something in the **documentation** is not clear enough. 

- **How to report?**

Just try to explain **what happens** and **what is expected to happen** . Also, it would be very useful to provide **a way to reproduce the issue** and **logs that show the issue**

### Pull request Guidelines
Reference your PR to a related issue (if one exists) and provide a description of the changes proposed.
Make sure you follow the code guidelines described in the section [code guidelines](./code-guidelines).

## Skills

### New skills
New skills are always welcome. A guide on how to create skills for Project Alice can be found in the section [skill-development](../skill-development)

### Translations
We are currently natively supporting the following languages:
- English
- German
- French
- Italian
Beside these languages, we provide support for nearly all languages in the world, for as long as you do not set Alice as offline only. We can use Google Translate free services to obtain a good result when sending the request to our NLU. Commit your changes every now and then and [Push](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) them on your repository. Once everything is done and you have run the [basic verifications](../skill-development/publishing-to-skill-store.md), you can create a [Pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) which we will review and merge if possible and otherwise inform you of what's still needed.

However not all skills are translated into all these languages yet.
You can add translations for one of the languages we already support, or any other language you would like to be supported in the future.


You will need a [Github](https://github.com) account to translate skills. Once you have your account and are logged in, simply [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the skill you want to translate. [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github) your fork on your computer and do the translation 


The sections [talk files](../skill-development/talk-file.md) and [dialog templates]() provide further information about the files that need to be translated.

### Pull request Guidelines
Reference your PR to a related issue (if one exists) and provide a description of the changes proposed.
Make sure you follow the code guidelines described in the section [code guidelines](./code-guidelines).
To validate your skill you can use the Alice Skill Kit as described in the section [alice skill kit]()
